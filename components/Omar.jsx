                    I'm Omar Jabraoui, a frontend developer and web designer living in Italy. I design and develop websites for both companies and individuals.
                    I started out as a Video Editor and Graphic Designer creating services for some clients and now I work in the field of Web Design and Development.
                    I work with HTML, CSS, JS, React, Bootstrap, MySQL, Php, NodeJS and Express. As for the design, I mainly use Figma for UI / UX, but besides it I also know the Adobe suite.
